## Dotfiles
i reinstall arch ALOT and i hate having to archive these onto a separate drive so i just made a repo


also to quick install all of the packages run
```sudo pacman -S --needed - < packagesneeded.txt```

ur gonna need to use yay or paru to get mpvpaper or build it urself
AND IF U WANT THE SCREENSHOT TOOL TO WORK U GOTTA GET `wayfreeze` and for other packages that arent on the offical repo youll need  `activate-linux` and `swaysome` and `swaylock-effects` and `way-audio-idle-inhibit-git`
